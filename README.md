
## Folder description

- assets-dev: The plain resources for dev, debugging
- assets: The encrypted resources for online or publish

## Build and run

- Clone [axmol](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol)(another cocos2d-x fork) and run setup.py in root of engine

- Use cmake to build

  ```bat
  REM Ensure visual studio 2019 or 2022 installed
  cmake -B build_x86 -A Win32 -DBUILD_EXTENSION_FAIRYGUI=OFF -DBUILD_EXTENSION_GUI=OFF
  cmake --build build_x86 --target HelloLua
  ```

- Open build_x86/HelloLua.sln, and press F5 to run, by default the vs debugging working directory is the encrypted folder `assets`,
 everything should be fine if the decrypt work well. 

## Use a new key & ivec to encrypt resources

- Method A:
  - Delete file encrypt-cfg.xml and run do-encrypt.bat
  
- Method B:
  - run command: "%XS_INSTDIR%\x-studio" -c -enc -cfg=.\encrypt-cfg.xml -nk -i=.\assets-dev -o=.\assets
  
- After reencrypt with new key, you needs change it at AppDelegate.cpp

## For more usage of x-studio encrypt system, run follow command:

"%XS_INSTDIR%\x-studio" -c --help
